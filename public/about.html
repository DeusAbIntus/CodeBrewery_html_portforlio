<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an engineer by trade but life-long learner and Challenge -seeker at heart. Whenevder I stumble across something 
  that is new or thrilling, my pre frontal contex activate and and dont rest till i have obsesses over it.</p>

<p>For the longest time in my life i used to follow what others told me to do or what was expected of me. 
  coming from a traditional background and a collective society, I was always told to follow the path that was laid out for me.
  But I always felt that there was something more to life than just following the herd. I wanted to carve my own path,
  to explore the world, and to discover my true self.

<p>I was first introduced to coding in school but I only learned it enough to pass an exam because it wasnt really something I wanted to do from the heart.
  I wasnt sure what i wanted to do really because most of my energy was spent trying to fit in and be like everyone else. I tried to make sense of a world that I didnt seem to understand and that didnt want to understand me.
  But computer and video games always seemed to give me an escape from reality.
  I was fascinated by the way they were made and how they worked. I wanted to create my own games and experiences, but I never thought it was possible.
  That is when the passion for programming was ignited in me.
